Subdirectories:

  * `earley1` - basic implementation of Earley; no caching of terminal
    parses; referred to as 

  * `earley2` - caches terminal parses; export oracle and terminal
    oracle

  * `earley3` - re-engineered earley, focusing on performance analysis

  * `earley3_v2` - as earley3, but optimizing (e.g. combining todo and
    done sets)

  * `earley3_v3` - imperative features

  * `minip3_e2` - `minip3_v2` with `earley2`

  * `minip3_v2` - minip3 updated to uses boxing (for memoization) and
    generalized over input type (can parse arbitrary inputs, not just
    strings); types are consequently more complex than `minip3_v1`

  * `misc` - contains `g2g.ml` which is a tool to transform grammars
    by replacing actions with actions which output parse trees; useful
    for inspecting ambiguity in parses

  * `p1` - parser from CPP'11 paper on verified, sound and complete
    parsing; bad O(n^5) performance on left-recursive grammars

  * `p3_e1` - an old version of p3 that uses `earley1` 

  * `p3_v1` - an old version of p3 that uses `earley2`
 
  * `p3_v2` - new version of p3 that uses `earley2`

  * `p3_v3` - new version of p3 that uses `earley3`
