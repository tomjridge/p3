The subdirectories are:

  * `actions` - examples involving applying actions (in addition to
    parsing)

  * `binarized_grammars` - some grammars in binarized form (P3
    typically transforms grammars to binarized form before parsing)

  * `grammars` - some example grammars; can be parsed using
    e.g. `../src/earley2_main.native -g grammars/E_EEE.g -f inputs/1_0010.txt`

  * `inputs` - inputs for grammars in `grammars`

  * `lexer` - example of using P3 with a lexing pass before parsing

  * `modular_opsem` - example of modular specification of parsers, and
    their combination (lambda calculus, arithmetic and booleans);
    culminates in a parser and evaluator for a lambda calculus
    extended with various constructs

  * `ocaml_parser` - parser for OCaml, based on the official OCaml
    grammar
